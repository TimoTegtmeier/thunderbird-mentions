# Mentions of contacts on email composer
This Add-On is a fork of [Thunderbird Mentions](https://github.com/joax/thunderbird-mentions) and
implements the feature of adding contacts onto the email body with a link to email the contact.
This feature was seen in other email applications like Outlook, Gmail or Yahoo Mail.
It aims to be Outlook compatible.

## Requirements
This add-on has been tested on Thunderbird 102.0 on various operating systems. Please provide feedback or issues and bugs via the issues tab of this repo.

# Install
You can download the XPI file direcly from the releases or find this add-on on the Thuderbird add-ons page searching for 'mentions'.
If you downloaded the XPI, you can install it by going to Add-Ons > Install Add-on from File.

# Instructions
The process is as easy as possible, simply enter an @ while writing your e-mail, which will trigger the search. Start typing the name or email of the person you'd like to include.
If this contact is found in your address books, then select it (either arrow down + Enter or click on it).
This will add the contact link to the text. Every mentioned person will automatically be added to list of recipients, unless the person is already there (on in CC).

# Feedback or improvements
Happy to work on the suggestions via the Add-on page or the Issues page on this repository.
